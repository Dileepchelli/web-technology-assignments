       <p>The Pulsar is my favourite bike, and it holds a special place in my heart because it was my first bike. I started learning how to ride on this bike, so it brings back a lot of memories. Pulsar, made by Bajaj Auto, is known for its sporty design and powerful performance. The models like Pulsar 150 are great choices, offering powerful engines, good mileage, and features like ABS and digital displays. Its aggressive styling and handling made it the perfect companion during my learning phase, and that's why itâ€™s my all-time favourite bike.</p>

Big tyres, high ground clearance, strong ladder-frame chassis and terrain modes make it perfect for off-road trails, mud, sand or snow.

      <P>My third favourite thing is my Lenovo IdeaPad laptop, which is also the first laptop I bought with my own money. It feels special because it reminds me of my hard work and independence. The IdeaPad has a slim, lightweight design that makes it easy to carry anywhere. I use it for learning new skills, completing projects, and enjoying games or movies in my free time. Its smooth performance, clear display, and long battery life make studying and working more comfortable. Whenever I open it, I feel proud that I earned it myself, and it motivates me to keep improving every day.</P>

        <p>My fifth favourite thing is playing badminton, which I enjoy every morning. It keeps me active, healthy, and full of energy for the whole day. I love the fast movements, quick smashes, and the way it improves my focus and reflexes. Playing with friends makes it even more fun and helps me build good teamwork skills. Badminton is also a great way to stay fit and reduce stress after long hours of study or work. Each time I step onto the court with my racket, I feel fresh and motivated to give my best.</p>
